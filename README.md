I was able to achieve this design quite easily owing to the experience gained with the QR component challenge on [Fontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Horizontal and Vertical centering was achieved with the snippet below;

```css
body {
    height: 100vh;
    display: grid;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}
```
